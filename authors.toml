# For security, CI jobs triggered by a GitHub pull request should only run on
# Airflow infra when they are from a user that is in this list.
# 
# This list consists of the airflow committers and other known, trusted
# authors. Currently maintained by hand; and the AWS SSM parameter is still
# the source of truth, so changes here must also be replicated there.
